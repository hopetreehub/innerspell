  - [ ] Stack traces never exposed
  - [ ] Internal paths not revealed
  - [ ] Database errors sanitized

- [ ] **Error Tracking**
  - [ ] All errors logged with context
  - [ ] Error rates monitored
  - [ ] Alerting configured
  - [ ] Error patterns analyzed

### Security Logging
- [ ] **Audit Trail**
  - [ ] Authentication attempts logged
  - [ ] Authorization failures tracked
  - [ ] Data modifications recorded
  - [ ] Admin actions audited

- [ ] **Log Security**
  - [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data
