# Card Spread Feature Fix Report

## Overview
The card spread feature has been successfully fixed to make it "normal/proper" with improved spacing and interaction.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Card Spacing** ✅
- **Before**: Cards were spaced only 35px apart, causing extreme overlap (>75%)
- **After**: Cards are now spaced 85px apart, providing better visibility and easier selection
- **Code Change**: `left: ${index * 35}px` → `left: ${index * 85}px`

### 2. **Container Height** ✅
- **Before**: Container height was only 26px, severely limiting card visibility
- **After**: Container has a minimum height of 320px with inner div height of 280px
- **Code Changes**:
  ```tsx
  style={{ minHeight: '320px' }}  // Container
  style={{ height: '280px' }}      // Inner div
  ```

### 3. **Hover Z-Index** ✅
- **Before**: Hover z-index was 50, sometimes not enough to bring cards fully to front
- **After**: Hover z-index increased to 100 for guaranteed visibility
- **Code Change**: `hover:z-50` → `hover:z-[100]`

### 4. **Padding Improvements** ✅
- **Before**: Minimal padding (p-2) made cards too close to edges
- **After**: Increased padding (p-4) for better visual breathing room
- **Code Change**: `p-2` → `p-4`

### 5. **Container Layout** ✅
- Added `flex items-center` to the inner div for proper vertical alignment
- Increased right padding from 125px to 200px for better scrolling experience

## Visual Improvements

The card spread now:
- Shows all 78 cards in a horizontal scrollable container
- Each card is clearly visible with only partial overlap
- Cards smoothly scale up and elevate on hover
- Clicking cards is much easier, even for cards in the middle of the spread

## Testing Instructions

To verify the improvements:

1. **Navigate to the Reading Page**
   - Go to http://localhost:4000/reading

2. **Set Up a Reading**
   - Enter any question in the text area
   - Select "Trinity View (3장)" or any spread type

3. **Shuffle and Spread Cards**
   - Click on the card deck to shuffle
   - Click "카드 펼치기" (Spread Cards) button

4. **Test Card Interactions**
   - Hover over cards - they should scale up and come to the front
   - Click on any card - it should be selectable even if partially hidden
   - Try selecting cards from different positions (beginning, middle, end)
   - The selection counter should update (e.g., "선택된 카드 (1/3 선택됨)")

5. **Verify Spacing**
   - Cards should have reasonable overlap (about 35-40% overlap)
   - All cards should be clickable
   - Scrolling should work smoothly
