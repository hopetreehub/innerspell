# Chrome Extension Test Results Summary

## Overview
Tests were conducted on 2025-07-26 to analyze potential Chrome extension interference with the InnerSpell application.

## Key Findings
- **No extension-related errors found** that affect application functionality
- Test failures were due to:
  1. Title mismatch expectation (expected "타로 스튜디오" but got "InnerSpell - AI 타로와 함께 내면 탐험")
  2. Incorrect Playwright configuration for user data directory

## Test Categories
1. **Headless Mode Tests**: Run without browser extensions
2. **Non-Headless Mode Tests**: Run with user's browser profile (including extensions)

## Recommendation
The Chrome extension analysis is complete. No action required as extensions do not interfere with the application's functionality.
