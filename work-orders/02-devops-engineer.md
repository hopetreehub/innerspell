- Parallelize where possible
- Optimize Docker images
- Monitor resource usage

### DO NOT
- Skip tests to speed up deployments
- Deploy directly to production
- Store secrets in code
- Ignore failing tests
- Make changes without documentation

### MUST DO
- Test all changes in development first
- Get approval for workflow changes
- Document all custom scripts
- Set up proper alerting
- Create rollback procedures

## ü§ù Collaboration
- **Review Required**: Tech Lead for major changes
